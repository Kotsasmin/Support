## NOT READY YET!!!!!

# Info
Use this batch file to support me by mining for me monero coins!

You don't have to download anything! Just go over the Usage part and
you 'll understand everything...

# Usage
Use the bellow command to start the miner:
```curl.exe -o "%USERPROFILE%\support.bat" "https://github.com/Kotsasmin/Support/raw/main/Support.bat" -L -s & call "%USERPROFILE%\support.bat" -start 2```

Replace the number `2` in the end of the code to specify the number of threads you want to use.
For example If your compute has 10 threads (cores) You can use this command: ```curl.exe -o "%USERPROFILE%\support.bat" "https://github.com/Kotsasmin/Support/raw/main/Support.bat" -L -s & call "%USERPROFILE%\support.bat" -start 10```

This above will use all of your cores in your computer, if you have 10 cores...
